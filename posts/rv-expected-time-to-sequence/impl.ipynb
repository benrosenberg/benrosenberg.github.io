    "The hardest part of automating this calculation is the generation of the state machine, from which the matrix and relevant calculation follow easily. The creation of the state machine is typically a manual process, but if we are trying to do this generally for any sequence (without resorting to empirical means), we should experiment with alternative methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "One method for generating state machines programmatically is by converting a regular expression into a DFA, or deterministic finite automaton. In our use case, we want to have a regular expression for a string that contains our desired sequence. It's fine if it has the sequence multiple times. This may be counterintuitive because in our experiment we'll stop as soon as the sequence is seen, and so we might think not to accept the string if it contains the sequence more than once - but in fact, the DFA will accept the string as soon as it's seen, and after that it's effectively stopped computing.\n",

    "\n",
    "The only difference from the first image is that the last state is marked as an accepting, or final, state as indicated by the double circle. \n",
    "\n",
    "The regular expression to which this DFA corresponds is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(H|T)*HTH(H|T)*\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be translated as \"any number of H's and/or T's (the asterisk means \"zero or more\"), and somewhere in there is a sequence of HTH, and then any number of H's and/or T's again\". This is a simple regular expression to generate, so the only work left to do should be to just convert the generated regex to a DFA, and then use the DFA as a DTMC by assigning probabilities to the RV outputs along the edges of the automaton."
