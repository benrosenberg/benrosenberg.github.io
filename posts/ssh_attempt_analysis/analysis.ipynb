There are more granular databases that you can download from MaxMind or from GitHub that have data at the city or ASN levels, but for my purposes country was fine.\n",

We need to enclose the country name in double quotes so that gnuplot groups the entire country name together - in \"United States\" for example, if we didn't enclose the country name in double quotes, gnuplot would just display `United` as the x-tick label.\n",
