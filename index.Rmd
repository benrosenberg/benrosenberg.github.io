### About me


I'm a student at Cornell University pursuing a bachelor's in Operations Research Engineering. I plan on graduating in 2022.

I've got a wide range of interests, including $\LaTeX$, Python, Linux, piano, and chess.

### Projects

For the sake of organization, I have another GitHub account which I use to host small projects of mine. Check it our [here](https://github.com/integralleft).

### Miscellaneous

I have [another website](https://gute.pw) which I use as a personal reference for various things (including some shell commands, mathematical formulas, and my `preamble.tex` file for LaTeX documents), although it also has some of my homeworks and other work from various courses I've taken. Again for the sake of organization, I store all the files for each of the classes I take in a separate Git repository on a [GitLab account](https://gitlab.com/integralLeft). (For obvious reasons, I don't have the visibility of the repos for the courses I'm currently taking set to public.)

### Contact

You can contact me [here](mailto:bar94@cornell.edu).
