### About me


I'm a student at Cornell University pursuing a bachelor's in Operations Research Engineering. I plan on graduating in 2022.

I have a wide range of interests, including typesetting and document creation ($\LaTeX$, Pandoc, Markdown, [`groff`](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groff_(software)), Python, Linux, piano, and chess.

### Projects

For the sake of organization, I have another GitHub account which I use to host small projects of mine. Check it out [here](https://github.com/integralleft). 

I'm currently working on a project analyzing gun violence, the exploratory analysis for which can be seen [here](https://benrosenberg.info/Gun-Violence-Analysis).

### Miscellaneous

I have [another website](https://gute.pw) which I use as a personal reference for various things (including some shell commands, mathematical formulas, and my `preamble.tex` file for $\LaTeX$ documents), although it also has some of my homeworks and other work from various courses I've taken. 

### Contact
