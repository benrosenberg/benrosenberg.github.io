### About me


I'm a student at Cornell University pursuing a bachelor's in Operations Research Engineering with a minor in Mathematics. I plan on graduating in 2022.

I have a wide range of interests, including typesetting and document creation ($\LaTeX$, Pandoc, Markdown, [`groff`](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groff_(software))), Python, Linux, piano, and chess. More professional interests of mine are data science and education.

### Projects

 - [Truth table generator](https://github.com/benrosenberg/truth-table-generator), with algorithmic input parsing and support for $\LaTeX$ output
 - Gun Violence Analysis
   - [Exploratory analysis](https://benrosenberg.info/Gun-Violence-Analysis) (final project coming soon)
 - [Discord bots and typesetting tools](https://github.com/integralLeft)

### Miscellaneous

I have [another website](https://gute.pw) which I use as a personal reference for various things (including some shell commands, mathematical formulas, and my `preamble.tex` file for $\LaTeX$ documents), although it also has some of my homeworks and other work from various courses I've taken.
